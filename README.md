## Set Up on Your Own Machine

When you want to dive deeper or apply it on a larger scale, you can configure our SegMiF on your computer by following the steps below.

#### Virtual Environment

We strongly recommend that you use Conda as a package manager.

```shell
# create virtual environment
conda create -n SegMiF python=3.10
conda activate SegMiF
# select pytorch version yourself
# install SegMiF requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
